### Why Polymorphism Couldn't Happen
Since this project is super simple, it's hard to justify a way to implement polymorphism,<br>
especially since all the functions have the same function. The printing of messages to the screen has parameters,<br>
but isn't overloaded. Our game instead heavily uses inheritance. SInce th behavior of classes don't need to change or<br>
be overidden, there is no use for polymorphism, and forcing it would do more harm than good.
